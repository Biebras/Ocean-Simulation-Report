This research is centered on the development and implementation of a real-time ocean simulation model. The model addresses several significant challenges in the field, including the elimination of tiling artifacts, adaptability to a range of weather conditions from calm to stormy, and efficient rendering capabilities across both low and high-end devices.

The cornerstone of this research is the introduction of a Fourier Transform-based ocean model. This model is unique in its use of empirical data, which allows it to accurately simulate various weather conditions. Additionally, the model employs multiple cascades to effectively eliminate the common issue of tiling, enhancing the visual continuity of the simulated ocean surface.

To ensure broad device compatibility and efficient performance, the entire solution has been implemented on a GPU. This includes the integration of a Fast Fourier Transform algorithm, which enables the model to function efficiently across a wide range of devices.
